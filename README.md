# CrossChainLottery-Brussels2024


We use:
Chainlink VRF to get make a lottery(Getting a random value from Chainlink VRF)
Chainlink CCIP to send winner's rewards on sponsor chain
Blockscout to view transactions on the webpage



Idea of a project is to collect funds on one chain,
and distubute rewards on another.

The main goal of such a system is to bring more new users(stakeholders) to a not very popular chain or tokens.

## Who will use it
Porjects that want to get more users, come to us and connect to our lottery game.
